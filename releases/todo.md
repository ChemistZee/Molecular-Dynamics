## TODO's for the next release:
 - better VMD tutorial on how to make trajectories pretty (maybe use a different program all together)
 - better cover artwork for exercise 3 (section 6)
 - Cover Art for the exercises 6 and 7 (MBAR and US-WHAM)
 - simplification of exercise 9 
   - idea: skip the ZINC20 database usage and supply distilled compound library ready-for use in required formats)
 - add meeko to exercise 9 to create PDBQT files for both AutoDock-GPU and Vina, and for exporting the docking results back to SDF. It writes a SMILES string in the PDBQT remarks and uses it to create an RDKit molecule
   - see Issue suggesting Meeko to accurately convert PDBQT/DLG to SDF #1
